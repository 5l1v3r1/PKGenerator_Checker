''' HEY THERE PIRATE!

THIS IS A 2017... no... 2018 FACELIFT TO THE TOY APP POOR MANS MINING.
HUNT THEM 2010 ERA COINS!!!!  Currently the Script uses Directory.IO
and blockchain.info to parse (at random) the entire sha256 keylist page by page
256 different lookups per page (1 for compressesed public address one for standard.
Feel Free to checkout Line 63 IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW HOW BIG THIS IS...
and impractical mind you!  This script may be your friend if you - can setup
and distribute this, like a botnet so that its scanning all the time from different
machines and ultimately pinging you on anything found.  You are literally stealing
someone else's private key - if the BTC utxo's are OLD like 2010 old you may be
able to comformably claim those - if the funds are a couple months old however,
you may need to consider returning a large portion if not all of them back to the
rightful owner.  Just like with my PK generator/checker tool this is literally for
enteratinment purposes and not designed for extended real world use.  Your IP
Address may become blocked from using this toy extensively, proceed with caution.
If you DO actually happen to find a collision (ie someone else's private key),
pat yourself on the back because that's supposed to not be possible...and maybe
send a few duckets my way: 18ZVx4i7FKYj6GYa1XgBM2ZfQdjE6nUMgt
